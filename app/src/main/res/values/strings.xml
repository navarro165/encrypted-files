    <string name="how_app_works_title">How This App Works</string>
    <string name="how_app_works_description">This app provides a secure vault for your digital files. It allows you to encrypt and store various file types, including photos and videos, within a protected directory on your device. Key features include:\n- **Secure Storage:** Files are encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.\n- **Biometric Protection:** Access to encrypted content is secured with your device\'s biometric authentication.\n- **File Management:** Easily add, view, delete, rename, and export your encrypted files and folders.</string>
    <string name="basic_instructions_title">Basic Instructions</string>
    <string name="basic_instructions_description">To get started with the app, follow these simple steps:\n- **Adding Files/Folders:**\n    - Tap the \'Add Files\' button.\n    - Choose \'Add Files\' to select individual files (you can select multiple).\n    - Choose \'Add Folder\' to select an entire directory for encryption.\n    - After adding, you\'ll be asked if you want to delete the original unencrypted file.\n- **Navigating Files and Folders:**\n    - Tap on a folder to view its contents.\n    - Use your device\'s back button to go up one level in the directory hierarchy.\n- **Viewing Encrypted Content:**\n    - Tap on an encrypted file to view its content. Biometric authentication will be required to decrypt and display the file.\n- **Managing Files (Long-Press for Options):**\n    - **Multi-Selection:** Long-press on any file or folder to enter multi-selection mode. Tap other items to select/deselect them.\n    - **Delete:** With items selected, tap the trash can icon in the top bar to delete them. A confirmation will appear.\n    - **Export:** With items selected, tap the export icon (box with arrow) to decrypt and save them to a location on your device.\n    - **Rename:** Long-press on a single file or folder, then select \'Rename\' from the contextual menu to change its name.</string>
    <string name="architecture_security_title">Architecture and Security</string>
    <string name="architecture_security_description">The app employs advanced security measures to protect your data:\n\n**Hardware-Backed Security:**\n- Master encryption keys are generated and stored in Android Keystore with StrongBox backing when available\n- Keys are hardware-protected and require biometric authentication for access\n- Keys become invalid if biometric enrollment changes, preventing unauthorized access\n\n**Advanced Encryption:**\n- Files encrypted using AES-256-GCM providing authenticated encryption\n- Each file receives a unique 256-bit encryption key from Android Keystore\n- 96-bit initialization vectors ensure encryption uniqueness\n- GCM mode provides both confidentiality and integrity protection\n\n**Secure Key Management:**\n- File-specific keys derived from hardware-protected master key\n- Keys stored in EncryptedSharedPreferences, never as plaintext files\n- Argon2id hashing with 4 iterations, 128MB memory for PIN security\n- Automatic key migration from any legacy plaintext storage\n\n**Authentication and Session Management:**\n- Biometric authentication required with 5-minute session timeout\n- Authentication state persists securely across app restarts\n- No authentication bypass methods exposed\n\n**Anti-Leakage Protection:**\n- Android backup explicitly disabled (allowBackup=false)\n- Encrypted files and keys excluded from cloud sync and device transfers\n- Memory-efficient streaming prevents large file memory attacks\n- ProGuard obfuscation protects against reverse engineering\n\n**Standards Compliance:**\n- Follows OWASP Mobile Security guidelines\n- Uses Android security best practices\n- Implements defense-in-depth security architecture</string>
