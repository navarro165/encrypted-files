- **üìÅ File Management**: Add, view, delete, rename, and export encrypted files
- **üóÇÔ∏è Folder Organization**: Create and navigate folder structures
- **üîÑ Multi-Selection**: Bulk operations for efficient file management  
- **üì± Multiple File Types**: Support for images, videos, text files, and more
- **‚ö° Session Management**: 5-minute authentication timeout for security
- **üö´ Screenshot Protection**: Prevents screenshots and screen recording
- **üîß Path Traversal Protection**: Advanced filename sanitization and validation
- **üß† Memory Security**: Encrypted memory buffers with secure wiping
- **üìä Folder Encryption**: Support for encrypting entire folder structures

## Security

This app uses advanced security measures designed to resist attacks:

### Core Security
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption with hardware-backed keys
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Biometric + PIN required together
- **Android Keystore** integration with hardware attestation
- **Argon2id** PIN hashing with memory-hard parameters
- **App sandbox** isolation with no external storage access
- **Secure deletion** with multi-pass overwrite

### Advanced Protection
- **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Real-time threat monitoring
- **Memory encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted in memory
- **Anti-tampering**: Code integrity verification and emergency wipe
- **Screenshot protection**: FLAG_SECURE prevents screen capture
- **Anti-debugging**: Debugger and instrumentation detection
- **Secure memory wiping**: Multi-pass memory overwriting

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher
- Device with biometric authentication capability

### Installation

#### üì± **Install Pre-built APK (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/navarro165/encrypted-files/releases)
2. Download `app-debug.apk` from the latest release
3. Enable "Install unknown apps" in Android Settings ‚Üí Security  
4. Open the APK file to install

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Build from Source**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/navarro165/encrypted-files.git
cd encrypted-files

# Build installable APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (requires keystore)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Note**: The debug APK is signed and ready for installation. The release APK requires keystore configuration.

#### üîß **Installation Troubleshooting**
- **"App not installed - package appears invalid"**: Download `app-debug.apk` instead of `release-apk`
- **"Install blocked"**: Enable "Install unknown apps" in Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Install unknown apps ‚Üí Select your browser/file manager ‚Üí Allow
- **"Parse error"**: Ensure you downloaded the complete APK file (should be ~8-15MB)

### Usage

1. **Adding Files**: Tap "Add Files" ‚Üí Authenticate ‚Üí Select files
2. **Viewing Files**: Tap file ‚Üí Authenticate ‚Üí View content
3. **File Management**: Long-press for multi-selection, use contextual menu

## Development

### Build Variants
```bash
# Debug build (for development)
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Staging build (for testing)
./gradlew assembleStaging

# Release build (for production)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests (recommended)
./gradlew test

# Run security-specific tests
./gradlew test --tests "*Security*"

## Security Notes

- **Local Storage Only**: All files encrypted and stored locally in app sandbox
- **No Cloud Sync**: No data transmission or cloud synchronization  
- **Biometric Required**: Strong biometric authentication with no password fallback
- **Hardware Security**: Uses Android Keystore with hardware-backed keys when available
- **Memory Protection**: Streaming encryption/decryption with secure cleanup
- **Anti-Tampering**: GCM authentication tags detect any file modifications
- **Secure Deletion**: 3-pass random overwrite before file deletion
- **Session Security**: 5-minute authentication timeout with rate limiting
- **Data Loss Risk**: App uninstall permanently destroys all files
